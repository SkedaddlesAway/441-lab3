# ITMD 441 LAB 3
## Introduction
This lab will have you write a very simple HTML and CSS UI for a tip calculator and add the JavaScript needed
to make it work.
## Requirements
Use the included wireframe mockup as a guide to what components should be in the app UI and a general
layout. You need to include everything in the mockup, but you may lay it out differently. Just make sure it is
clear to understand how it would work
